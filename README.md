# Spinning Hatsune Miku!

### What is it?

It's a home-made alternative to DesktopMate, using a model I found on Sketchfab!

### Okay but why?

This was supposed to originaly be a joke, but it got serious enough that I decided to release it.

### How did you do this?

It's fully made in Godot, it's really not that hard to make this.

### AI?

No. I refuse to use it.


### How do you use it?

Click and drag Miku to move her around, use the scrollwheel to resize her, and right click her torso to show the settings menu.
