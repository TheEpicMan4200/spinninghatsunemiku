# Spinning Hatsune Miku!

### What is it?

It's a home-made alternative to DesktopMate, using a model i found on Sketchfab!

### Okay but why?

This was supposed to originall be a joke, but it got serious enough that i decided to release it.

### How did you do this?

It's fully made in Godot, it's really not that hard to make this.

### AI?

No. I refuse to use it.
